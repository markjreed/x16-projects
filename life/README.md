# Life
## A simple implementation of Conway's Life
Written in Irmen de Jong's [Prog8](https://github.com/irmen/prog8) programming language.

This implementation just uses the screen as the grid and has technically
incorrect behavior at the edges of the screen due to not
supporting any live cells outside that bounary.
